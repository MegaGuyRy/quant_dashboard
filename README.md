# Quant Dashboard
- Use app.py in specified order to make trades

### TODO:
- Improve decision making
- Selling positions (more strategy)

    
- Backtesting and result eval with streamlit Dashboard
    - Compare agaenst NASDAC 
    - live trades made today window

- Update Xboost_eval with the ability to choose the horizon

### Future changes:
- daily, weekly, monthly, yearly returns if applicable
- Tie it all together in app.py, make it pass all at once
- Backtesting mode – We could add a command to backtest using stored predictions vs actuals.
- Unit test hooks – We could expose these as functions for easier unit testing.
- Add logging (optional) – Replace or supplement print() statements with Python’s logging module for more control.
